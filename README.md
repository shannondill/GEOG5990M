## Coursework: final assignment
Spatial data science report

## Background information:
Leeds, UK
There are new cycle routes in the process of being built throughout Leeds.  One main project is building a 2km cycle and pedestrian route that will link the University of Leeds, Leeds Beckett University, and Leeds Arts University [1].  This is a 'Â£20.9m scheme aimed to improve journeys for those using sustainable transport along Woodhouse Lane, Blenheim Terrace, Blenheim Walk and Albion Street' [1].
Leeds City Council and West Yorkshire Combined Authority is looking to add another 7km of cycle routes to the existing paths, stating that thsi will link and fill any gaps 'in the existing and planned cycle network will deliver improved connectivity to, and around, the city centre' [2].
As these projects cost millions of pounds, it is important to ensure that the cycle paths are being placed in areas that may not already have access and expand the routes to areas furhter outside the city centre.  This will ensure cyclists safety when commuting to and from work, school, or other events.

## Aim of the code:
* Does distance travelled to work affect bicycle use for mode of transport, impacting a healthy lifestyle?
* Are there any other factors influencing the use of a bicycle to travel to work?
* What areas of Leeds are in need of more bicycle lanes?
